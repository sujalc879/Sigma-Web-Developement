        <h2>श्रीमंतयोगी</h2>

        <h3>On 19 February 1630, Shivaji Maharaj was born in a Maratha family at Shivneri Fort, Maharashtra. His steadfastness, bravery, and dominance served as examples for all who came after him. His courage knew no limits. He was a combatant who fought against injustice to promote the welfare of the populace. Shivaji Maharaj was regarded as a brave warrior who employed novel military strategies and was a skilled
            administrator. When he was a child, he used to read the glorious stories of Mahabharata and Ramayana. He not
            only internalised the solid and robust traits of the ideal Hindu's character but also adhered to their
            teachings from these two epics.</h3>
