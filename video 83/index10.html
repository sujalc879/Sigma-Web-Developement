<!-- 10. The Coffee Machine:
    In your coffee shop application, you need to simulate the process of brewing coffee asynchronously. Write an async function named brewCoffee that takes the type of coffee and returns a promise. The promise should resolve with a message indicating that the coffee is ready after a random delay.
